# LinkedIn Clone

This project is a clone of LinkedIn, built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The aim is to replicate essential features like user profiles, news feeds, job postings, and more, while leveraging modern web technologies to build a responsive and scalable web application. This project is also a personal endeavor to further develop my skills in React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, enhancing my understanding of frontend development and refining my ability to work with these tools.
